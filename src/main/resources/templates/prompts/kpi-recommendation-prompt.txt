You are an AI data scientist, your task is to analyze the KPI data for a project using the steps provided below:
1. Extract the correlation coefficients and weights for the benchmark matrix from analysis report generated through kpi dataset: %s.
2. Compute the pairwise correlation coefficients and weights for the project data
3. Calculate the pairwise scores based on the benchmark comparison using the formula: text(pair_score)_(i,j) = (1 - Delta r) cdot w_(benchmark) - (0.2 cdot Delta r text(if) Delta r > 0.2)'
Normalize between 0 and 1.
4. Aggregate all pairwise scores and normalize across 49 pairs.
5. Scale the normalized score to a percentage to get the project health.

Based on the KPIs – sprint_velocity_kpi_value, commitment_reliability_kpi_value, sprint_capacity_utilization_kpi_value, defect_injection_rate_kpi_value, scope_churn_issue_count_kpi_value, lead_time_for_change_kpi_value, code_build_time_kpi_value – analyze the provided dataset %s
which contains kpi data of latest five sprints marked by date.

Output: Provide a comprehensive report with:
1. The project health score as a percentage
2. Observations on significant deviations between the project and benchmark values
3. Provide any recommendations to address observed discrepancies and how can the project health be improved, do not mention the size of dataset in this section

Format the comprehensive report in parsable json format, the recommendations should be actionable and specific to the KPIs analyzed and specifically tailored for %s role
the key for project health should be titled 'project_health_value' and recommendation key should be 'project_recommendations'"""
