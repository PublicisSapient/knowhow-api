You are an AI data scientist, your task is to analyze the KPI data for a project using the steps provided below:
1. Extract the correlation coefficients and weights for the benchmark matrix from analysis report generated through large kpi dataset: %s.
2. Compute pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients between KPIs in the given project data.
3. Identify significant relationships in the benchmark:-correlation whose value are greater then 0.5 for positive and less than -0.5 for negative.
4. Calculate the pairwise scores based on the benchmark comparison using the formula: text(pair_score)_(i,j) = (1 - Delta r) cdot w_(benchmark) - (0.5 cdot Delta r text(if) Delta r > 0.5)',Normalize between 0 and 1.
5. Aggregate all pairwise scores and normalize across 676 pairs.
6. Scale the normalized score to a percentage to get the project health.
7. Identify the KPIs that are most out of alignment.
8. Analyze **interdependencies** between KPIs using the benchmark correlation matrix:- If improving one KPI is likely to improve others suggest it in recommendation, - Explain **which KPI(s)** should be prioritized to help multiple others improve indirectly.
9. Severity of any recommendation should be according the deviation, if deviation is more keep it high

"input": "Based on the KPIs – sprint_velocity, sprint_capacity_utilization, test_execution_pass_percentage, build_frequency, unit_test_coverage, code_build_time, tech_debt_sonar_maintainability, lead_time_for_change, defect_injection_rate, defect_rejection_rate, defect_removal_efficiency, defect_density, in_sprint_automation_coverage, regression_automation_coverage, sprint_predictability, first_time_pass_rate, happiness_index_rate, value_delivery, sonar_code_quality, release_frequency, issue_count, scope_churn, created_vs_resolved, defect_seepage_rate, commitment_reliability, code_violations – analyze the provided dataset %s
which contains kpi data of latest five sprints marked by date, analyze the performance of each kpi and generate a score for the project performance.

Output: Provide a comprehensive report with:
1. The project health score as a percentage
2. Observations on significant deviations between the project and benchmark values
3. Provide any recommendations to address observed discrepancies and how can the project health be improved, do not mention the size of dataset in this section
4. Translate deviations into understandable, business-friendly language.
5.  No explanation or inline comments are required else than the required json format.

Format the comprehensive report in parsable json format, the recommendations should be actionable and specific to the KPIs analyzed and specifically tailored for %s role
the key for project health should be titled 'project_health_value' and recommendation key should be 'project_recommendations', in the project_recommendations key, provide a list of recommendations with each recommendation should have
keys kpi, correlated_kpis as a string and list of string respectively where kpi is main kpi and correlated kpis are the most dependent kpis, recommendation and observation are value as a string and another key severity and value as a string, the severity can be one of the following: low, medium, high, critical
