Below is the “analysis‐report” that summarizes the comprehensive pair–by–pair correlation analysis among the seven key‐performance indicator (KPI) columns on our multi–sprint project dataset. In this example we assume that all KPI values were measured using a Pearson–based procedure and that for each computed correlation a “weight” (an accuracy or reliability measure on a scale from 0 to 1, with values nearer 1 indicating very high confidence given the large number of sprints in the dataset) has been derived. (In our analysis no KPI was excluded and all 7×7 combinations – including the “self–correlations” – are shown.)

For reference, the seven KPIs are:

1. Sprint Velocity (sprint_velocity_kpi_value)
2. Commitment Reliability (commitment_reliability_kpi_value)
3. Sprint Capacity Utilization (sprint_capacity_utilization_kpi_value)
4. Defect Injection Rate (defect_injection_rate_kpi_value)
5. Scope Churn/Issue Count (scope_churn_issue_count_kpi_value)
6. Lead Time for Change (lead_time_for_change_kpi_value)
7. Code Build Time (code_build_time_kpi_value)

Note that the “weight” is our internal accuracy metric – obtained via a robust boot–strapping/confidence–interval procedure – and it tells us how “trustworthy” the estimated correlation is. In what follows every unique pair is shown (remember that A vs. B is the same as B vs. A, but we list each cell of the 7×7 matrix for completeness). Should you ever have a smaller dataset (say, only five sprints for one project), the same reporting format may be applied to “diagnose” overall project health by comparing the observed pairwise correlations and their reliability weights with these benchmark numbers.
